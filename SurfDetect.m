%                   FEATURE EXTRACTION USING SURF
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This code performs feature extraction, which is the first part of the SURF 
% (Speeded-Up Robust Features) algorithm for object recognition. 
%
% INPUT:  The input image provided should be an 8-bit RGB or 8-bit grayscale image. 
% OUTPUT: The output of this code is an array of extracted interest points. These 
%         interest points are also depicted over the input image in a figure window.
